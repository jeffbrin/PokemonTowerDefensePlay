GEN 1 and GEN 2 - Ripped by Celebi MM8BDM. Cleanups and sound edits BellBlitzKing - 657 WAV files

Any sounds that have "1" or "2" or anything after their original name are extra or split parts of an single or multi-turn attack. 

If a sound has "direct" or a "D"after its name, that means I was unsure if the created sound from combining all the parts of the sound, sounded the same to the direct version. (So its there for comparison)  There some extras here and there.


File name explanation.  Certain sounds used multiple channels and some had to be recorded separately.  After getting them separately, they were combined to make the full sound.  So Absorb1.wav and Absorb2.wav create Absorb.wav.  Anything else on the file name describes the sound.
